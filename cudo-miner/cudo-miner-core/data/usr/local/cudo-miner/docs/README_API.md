# Cudo Worker Core API

On startup the core will create the following Unix socket or Windows named pipe.

* `Windows` - `\\.\pipe\cudo-worker`
* `Linux & macOS` - `/var/lib/cudo-worker.sock`

An IPC API is exposed through this socket allowing actions to be executed and global events to be received.

## Messages

The protocol exposed by the core is [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) compliant with the addition of global event messages.

### Action

An action message consists of a request and response message tied together by a unique identifier integer.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "setOrganization",
  "params": ["sean"]
}
{
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "id": 129,
    "slug": "sean",
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

### Action Error

If there was a problem executing the action an error key will be returned in the response.

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "method": "getBenchmarks"
}
{
  "id": 2,
  "error": {
    "code": -3200,
    "message": "a problem happened"
  }
}
```

###Â Event

Event messages are broadcast to all connected clients.

```json
{
  "event": "organization",
  "params": [
    {
      "id": 129,
      "slug": "sean",
      "...": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```
